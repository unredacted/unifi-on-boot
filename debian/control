Description: Run scripts on boot on UniFi devices (firmware-upgrade-proof)
 A generic on-boot script runner for UniFi devices that executes scripts from
 /data/on_boot.d/ on every boot. Unlike udm-boot, this package properly
 integrates with Ubiquiti's ubnt-dpkg-cache/ubnt-dpkg-restore mechanism to
 survive firmware upgrades without manual intervention.
